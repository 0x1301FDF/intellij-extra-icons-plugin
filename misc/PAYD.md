The maintenance of free and opensource software is a complicated subject. 

From the user point of view, a free software is a gift to the community and, unfortunately, donations will not improve the project's qualities. 

From the maintainer point of view (actually, from _my_ point of view), this is a bit complex. I am a professional software developer, I know that my job (and the Internet) would be completely different without the free and opensource software provided by individual contributors or companies (yes, actually an important part of these projects are maintained by programmers which are paid by companies like IBM, VMware, RedHat, Microsoft, etc.), and that's why I want to participate in this initiative: I want to contribute.  

The fact is that I spend a lot of free time on these projects, for free. I worked on NetBeans IDE and plugins (JaCoCo support, spellcheckers), some misc tools (like a Steam tool used by some gamers: Steam Cleaner), Maven and Gradle plugins, and some IntelliJ plugins (7 for now, + 2 new plugins coming soon). I received some donations (0~20$ per year, and ~220$ last two years because a generous donor sent me 2x100$), but I'm not working for money: I already have a job.  

So, why am I asking for money now? First, I am not selling a _product_, I won't provide premium support to buyers (not for 5$, seriously), and the project is still free (I'm still using the MIT license) and opensource. You can analyse the source code, submit issues, contribute, and you can repackage the plugin for you as a free (gratis) plugin. You only have to pay if you want to download and use my version of the plugin, that is hosted on the JetBrains marketplace. Actually, **I think it's a way to support my work**. I'm spending so much time in my opensource projects, and even if I never expected to buy a Ferrari thanks to donations, I have to admit most users consume the opensource software like free games on the Google App Store. They want everything for free, they never congratulate the author (but they're OK to complain about issues). From my point of view, this attitude is discouraging, and that's why I decided to put my plugin on the JetBrains marketplace as a paid plugin: 5$ per year (I think it's totally affordable), price decreases over time, and it's free for students, teachers and OSS developers. **Supporters will buy my plugin. Others won't**, and I am happy with that. I don't want to work for customers, I want to work with contributors and supporters.

To finish, I don't know if it's feasible, I will ask a question to JetBrains, but I will try to offer lifetime licenses to contributors and donors. Stay tuned.
