The maintenance of free and opensource software is a complicated subject.

From the user point of view, a free software is a gift to the community and, unfortunately, donations will not improve the project's qualities.

From the maintainer point of view (actually, from _my_ point of view), this is a bit complex. I am a professional software developer, I know that my job (and the Internet) would be completely different without the free and opensource software provided by individual contributors or companies (yes, actually an important part of these projects are maintained by programmers which are paid by companies like IBM, VMware, RedHat, Microsoft, etc.), and that's why I want to participate in this initiative: I want to contribute.

The fact is that I spend a lot of free time on these projects, for free. I worked on NetBeans IDE and plugins (JaCoCo support, spellcheckers), some misc tools (like a Steam tool used by some gamers: Steam Cleaner), Maven and Gradle plugins, and some IntelliJ plugins (7 for now, + 2 new plugins coming soon). I received some donations (0~20$ per year, and ~220$ last two years because a donor sent me 2x100$ ^_^), and I would like to thank all my donors, they're fantastic. Meanwhile, I'm not working for money: I already have a very good job.

So, why am I asking for money now?  
First, I am not selling a _product_, I won't provide premium support to buyers (not for 5$, seriously), and the project is still free (I'm still using the MIT license) and opensource. You can analyse the source code, submit issues, contribute, and you can repackage the plugin for you as a free (gratis) plugin. You only have to pay if you want to download and use my version of the plugin, that is hosted on the JetBrains marketplace. Actually, **I think it's a way to support my work**.  
Secondly, I'm spending so much time in my opensource projects, and even if I never expected to buy a Ferrari thanks to donations, I have to admit most users are not aware of free software related issues (and I can't blame them for that) or, for a few of them, they simply want to consume the opensource software like free games on the Google App Store. From my point of view, this situation is discouraging, and that's why I decided to put my plugin on the JetBrains marketplace as a paid plugin for 5$ per year. I think it's totally affordable, price decreases over time, and it's free for students, teachers and OSS developers. **Supporters will buy my plugin. Others won't**, I am happy with that, and I won't blame you if you don't (or simply can't) support my work. I don't want to work for customers, I want to work with contributors and supporters.  
Please don't take it personally, this is a very difficult decision for me, there's no ideal solution, I may change my mind later (or not ^_^, I don't know), this is an experiment. I still love free and opensource development, I will stick to the MIT license, and that's why all my other projects are still free, opensource and gratis.

To finish, I don't know if it's feasible, I will ask a question to JetBrains, but I will try to offer lifetime licenses to contributors and donors. Stay tuned.
